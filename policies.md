## Your prior background

Data science uses code to analyze messy data.  We aim to teach you that in the
course.  To do the course, you do not need any previous experience of using
code or computing programming.  We expect a large proportion of the students
will be starting from scratch.

One advantage of data science methods is that we can use code to express
*algorithms* that the logical steps of the analysis.  It turns out that
expressing our analysis in this way makes it possible to avoid much of the
mathematics in data analysis and statistics.  We will use some simple
mathematics in the course, but nothing beyond what you have learned in your
secondary school / GCSE maths.

## Mixtures of experience

You do not need to have done any programming before, to take this course, but
some of you will have some programming experience.  If that is you, you will
find that you can go quickly through the early material in the course.  Your
work, in those early parts of the course, are to help the others to learn.  In
doing so, we think you will find that you get deeper understanding of
programming, and of the material.

If you do not have any previous experience of programming, you will find that
you need more time to learn the ideas and let them sink in.  Learning a
programming language is like learning any language, it takes time,
concentration and repetition.   Keep trying things that are a little bit
harder than you think you can manage.  It will be frustrating at first, but
you will [learn the value of
frustration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxwxefRAu70&feature=youtu.be&t=1803).

In a word, be *patient*.

## Mixtures of background

Data science is a subject that crosses all disciplines.  This can be exciting,
as we expand our interests and work out how to make sense of many kinds of
data.  It is also a challenge that needs patience.  As a data scientist, you
will need to listen carefully to understand unfamiliar ways of thinking, and
problems you had not thought about before.

In a word, be *patient*.

## Grading

Please do not worry about the grades.

Here is a short pause.

Please do not worry about the grades.

Your job, in this course, is to learn to think straight, about what can and
cannot be learned from data.  Along the way, we hope that you will find that
you are exploring interesting data and finding answers to interesting
questions.  If you have fun, as we hope you do, you will do well on the
course.

After every class, there will be an exercise for you to do.   Please use these
to find out how well you are doing, and to help us find out what we have
taught you, and what we have failed to teach, so we can do better in the next
class.

## Working together

You will find that data science involves a lot of collaboration.  Programmers
teach non-programmers, people who know the data problem teach those who do not
know, sceptics teach optimists, and optimists teach sceptics.

Please feel free to work with each other on the questions after each class.
You will learn more that way.  Be careful not to coast, otherwise you will
fall behind, and the learning will start to get harder and harder.

Be careful - although we strongly encourage you to work together when
learning, and discussing ideas, you can only submit your own work for grading.

## You can only submit your own work for grading

For the work you submit for grading, you must submit your own work, and you should not share your completed homework with anyone.

This is true for any written answer you give, and for your code answers.  You
will soon find that there are many different ways of writing some code to do
a particular task, so the code that you write is nearly as distinctive as your
prose.  We will look for signs that you have copied code and written answers
from each other, and we will treat this as plagiarism, in the same way as we
would for any other course.

## The difference between collaboration and copying

Do not work on the graded homework together, and you should never look at
anyone else's finished answers to the homework.  Do your best to finish all
the exercises and homework yourself.  If you get stuck, go back to the notes
and website and lectures.  If you are still stuck, please ask on the
discussion fora, or contact your TA or lecturer.  At this stage, you can also
discuss your problems with your fellow students, but *do not copy their code*.
By all means work out the solution in your discussion, with your classmates or
your teachers, but implement that solution yourself.  You will find that you
learn most this way, because your questions will be deeper and more useful
after you have worked on the material for a while.
