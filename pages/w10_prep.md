This week, as last, we will be using the book "Thinking clearly with data".

Check the link at the top of the Cortex menu for a link to the book on Perlego and the figure to download.

You will definitely need the figures for this prep.

Please read this chapter:

* Chapter 9: Why correlation does not imply causation

Do exercises:

* 9.3
* 9.4

We will discuss these in class.
