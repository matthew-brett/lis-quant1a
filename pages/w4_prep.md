Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West run a course at the University of Washington called [Calling Bullshit](https://www.callingbullshit.org). Quoting from that page:

> Our aim in this course is to teach you how to think critically about the
data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences.

This is an introduction to thinking about what bullshit it, and how to spot
it.

To prepare, first read this classic essay [On
Bullshit](https://www.perlego.com/book/734330/on-bullshit-pdf).  It is 80
short pages, and we think this will take you a less than 3 hours.

Next, do a [Bullshit
inventory](https://www.callingbullshit.org/exercises_inventory.html) — see the link for details.

Submit your inventory by Thursday 27th October - via the link on Cortex.

We will discuss your ideas in class.

We will also come back to the preparation from the previous week, once I have
sorted out the problem with the graphs in the "Thinking clearly with Data"
book on Perlego.  But feel free to read the actual copies of the book from the
library.
