The preparation for this week follows on the from preparation
from the previous two weeks.

## More on causality

We will be using the book "Thinking clearly with data".   Find it
on Perlego or in the library.  The library has three copies.  See
the section on the book at the top of the Cortex menu for a link
to the book and to the figures for the book, which are still
missing from the Perlego copy.

Read the following chapters:

* Preface
* Chapter 3: Causation
* Chapter 9: Why correlation does not imply causation

Do exercises:

* 3.1
* 3.4
* 9.3
* 9.4

We will discuss these in class.
