This is the first synchronous session.

## Housekeeping:

* Background reading.
* Working together.

## But why?

Some quick notes on:

* [Ode to code](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/code-basics/to_code.html)
* [Surviving the computer](https://lisds.github.io/textbook/intro/surviving_computers.html)

## On being wrong

Being wrong â€” is the hardest thing.

And so we discuss the first preparation exercise - the [Gapminder certificate
test](https://upgrader.gapminder.org/t/sdg-world-un-goals/c/sdg-world-un-goals-main).  For each:

* What information were you using when you gave your answer?
* Why did you have the wrong information?  Or what information were you missing, and why?
* How could you have got the right information to answer the question?
