This is an optional task.



This is a task, if you want to go further in your programming and coding skills, while integrating them with your quantitative knowledge.


In overview, we suggest you use your growing programming knowledge to work on solutions to problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Along the way, you can learn how to:

* Use Git and Github and
* Get and respond to code review.

you can go to Project Euler. This is a webpage that has an Archive of computational problems.



Try creating programs in Python (in a Jupyter notebook) to solve the first 3 problems (you can do more if you want). 



Make sure that your code works, it does what it is supposed to do, it follows Python good practices and that you also explain clearly, in words, what your program does and why it works correctly. 



Hand in your work in the submission box below (as a link to your Jupyter notebook) before the end of Friday the 18th of November.
