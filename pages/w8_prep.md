Carl Bergstrom and Jevin West run a course at the University of Washington
called [Calling Bullshit](https://www.callingbullshit.org). Quoting from that
page:

> Our aim in this course is to teach you how to think critically about the
data and models that constitute evidence in the social and natural sciences.

This is an introduction to thinking about what bullshit it, and how to spot
it.

To prepare, first read this classic essay [On
Bullshit](https://www.perlego.com/book/734330/on-bullshit-pdf).  It is 80
short pages, and we think this will take you a less than 3 hours.

Next, do a [Bullshit
inventory](https://www.callingbullshit.org/exercises_inventory.html) â€” see the
link for details.

Submit your inventory via this link on Cortex.

We will discuss your ideas in class.
