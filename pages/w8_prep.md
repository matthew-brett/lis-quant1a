**Note** A version of this prep initially appeared in the week 6 section on
Cortex.

The preparation for this week follows on from the preparation from week 6 (causality).

## More on causality

We will be using the book "Thinking clearly with data".   Find it on Perlego or
in the library.  The library has three copies.  See the [Thinking Clearly with
Data Cortex
page](https://cortex.lis.ac.uk/courses/2cc41688-a4c9-497f-8bc1-bc0a083bf51f/flows/2d1c62e5-91b6-4fec-aca6-3f67155f4430/activities/bd082bcb-d79c-4774-ac90-71d581f00f4d)
for a link to the book and to the figures for the book, which are missing from
the Perlego copy (I have filed a bug-report with Perlego about this).

Whenever you see a figure legend in the book, without the figure, you can get the matching figure from the links cited above.

Your task is to read the following chapters:

* Preface
* Chapter 3: Causation

Now do exercises:

* 3.1
* 3.2
* 3.3
* 3.4

We will discuss these in class on Thursday of week 8 (December 4).
