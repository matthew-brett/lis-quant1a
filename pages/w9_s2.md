## On Bullshit

What is bullshit?

Under what circumstances would you accept or produce Bullshit?

[1989 interview
quote](https://stephenschneider.stanford.edu/Mediarology/Mediarology.html) by
[Stephen
Schneider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Schneider_(scientist))
(Stanford professor of Environmental biology and global change).

> On the one hand, as scientists we are ethically bound to the scientific
method, in effect promising to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
– which means that we must include all doubts, the caveats, the ifs, ands and
buts. On the other hand, we are not just scientists but human beings as well.
And like most people we’d like to see the world a better place, which in this
context translates into our working to reduce the risk of potentially
disastrous climate change. To do that we need to get some broad based support,
to capture the public’s imagination. That, of course, means getting loads of
media coverage. So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified,
dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. This
“double ethical bind” we frequently find ourselves in cannot be solved by any
formula. Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being
effective and being honest. I hope that means being both.

## On visualization

About a figure in the [2017 Climate Science Special
Report](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/)

> There have been marked changes in temperature extremes across the contiguous
United States. The number of high temperature records set in the past two
decades far exceeds the number of low temperature records. (Very high
confidence) (Ch. 6, Fig. ES.5)

See [Figure ES5](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/img/figure/es-5.png)

What do you think?

## Expert panel review

[Review of the report](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24712/review-of-the-draft-climate-science-special-report):

> Key Finding 2 requires clarification and consistency of extreme
events with the figures and evidence described, as stated in the
Summary comments for this chapter. The statement that “the
temperature of extremely warm days has increased across much of
the West,” and “intense heat waves have become more common” is in
direct contradiction (in message) to Table 6.2, which shows
decreases in the warmest day of the year, and decreases in the
warmest 5-day 1-in-10 year event. This discrepancy needs to be
addressed. ... Further, it is difficult to understand how
a statement that includes increases in extreme warmth can be
associated with a high confidence or extremely likely statement,
given that most of the graphics in this chapter show a decrease
in extreme warmth in the historical record. — (p30).

[Response](https://science2017.globalchange.gov/PDFs/CSSR-NASresponse_110217.pdf):

> Almost every recommendation from the NAS review was
incorporated into the revised Chapter 6 (Temperature Changes in
the United States). ... a new figure was added on changes in
record high and low temperatures. — (p4).
